v0.1.26-dev (SVN)
+ Feature: For BA, when the PA(L)/Exoskeleton class is selected, users can now
    distinguish between PA(L) and Exoskeleton
+ Feature: Added ability to remove harjel for clan exoskeletons
+ Bug [#118]: Composite, endo-composite, and reinforced internal structure types
    have the wrong stats
+ Bug [#81]: Selecting Quad Chassis for Mech erases Year/Source/resets tech
    level
+ Bug [#79]: Selecting VTOL resets Year and Source/Era Fields
+ Feature: Tripods now display crits for the center leg in the critical view
+ Bug: spread mounts on tripods now function properly (things like blue shield,
    stealth armor, etc)

v0.1.25 (2014-02-22 23:21 UTC)
+ Filtered out equipment in the equipment table that gets added via the 
    StructureTab (jump boosters, partial wing, manipulators, etc).  Also removed
    some filtering that was intended for 'mechs and vees and isn't applicable
+ Bug: Enhancement check boxes weren't being checked when loading BA with those 
    enhnacements
+ Filter out Support Weapons for BA use on AP Mounts. Fix Header to blk not mtf.
+ Bug: Removing DWP's and weapons mounted in DWPs via the "Remove" button in

    they must be mounted via an AP Mount.  This wasn't enforced before and is 
    now.  To make it clear, unallocated AP weapons now display an * and the 
    tooltip explains how to mount AP weapons
+ BA Manipulators now show in the critical view, largely so you can detach AP
    weapons attached to Armored Gloves

    removed or deleted
+ Bug: AP weapons on BA could be assigned a location via right clicking 
+ Bug: Critical View now counts AP Mounts instead of infantry weapons
+ Bug: AP weapons where showing up in the ballisics list of weapons

    support mounted as well
